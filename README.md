# Hump3FLuidFlow

This is a repository for the fluid dynamics project of my first term during my master's degree in Higher School of Economics, Moscow.

The project is designed to apply double-deck boundary layer theory to the task of fluid flow around a small 3D hump. Firstly, asymptotic methods were applied to achieve the mathematical model of the process.

The repository relates to numerical modeling with finite difference method developed mathematical solution.
