# Hump3DWrapModeling

This is a repository for fluid dynamics project of my first term during master's degree in Higher School of Economics, Moscow.

The project is designed to apply double deck boundary layer theory to task of warping small 3D hump.
Fistly, asymptotic methods were applied to achieve mathematical model of the process.

The repository relates to numerical modeling with finite difference method developed mathematical solution. 

*work is still in progress*
